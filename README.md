# Brainslug's Userscripts for Torn
A collection of somewhat useful and less useful userscripts for Torn.

> These scripts have been created and tested using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). They might work in other browsers/runtimes but i give no guarantees! You're welcome to open an issue if it's not working for you ofcourse.

# Racing Scripts
## Custom Race Presets
Adds custom preset shortcuts when creating a new race. 
Configuration is possible both in the script itself or within Torn (presets will be persisted in the browser in this case).
This script was (heavily) based on the [Prefill Create Race Form](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/393632-torn-custom-race-presets) script made by Cryosis7 [926640].
> Be warned that updates might override any cusomizations you have made! So be sure to back it up. Removing the @ before @updateURL would also prevent this.

## Full Height Driver Panel
Adds style to make the driver panel full height on desktop (on mobile it already is). This way you can scroll and search the page instead of just the small driver window.

Install Link: [scripts/racing-full-height.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br41nslug/torn-brainscripts/main/scripts/racing-full-height.user.js)\

## Always On Top
Adds style to always pull you to the top row in a race. 
This helps tremendously helpful finding your own position in a running race with lots of members.

## Change Racing Banner
After being class A for a while i realized that i liked some of the lower class banners better so this script adds the option to switch between the different class banners.

![Screenshot Class D](/images/change-banner-D.png)\
![Screenshot Class E](/images/change-banner-E.png)

## Race Charts
This script adds a chart showing the positions held by each player over the duration of the match. This can be very useful for getting a quick judgement of whether it was a close match, a very one-sided one, if someone made a late comeback and more. 
> This is most likely not compatible with mobile devices! Also with races including lots of members the charts can get crowded and quite heave for the browser.

# Utility Scripts
## Custom Menu Links
Injects custom menu links into the Torn sidebar inspired by the Torn Tools update. 
Currently this script still requires you to configure the links inside the script itself (there is some inline documentation there to help you configure it).
